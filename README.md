# BLC

##Branch length correlation of gene trees and species trees

This is a test to filter contamination in phylogenomic datasets based on [Simion et al. (2017) in *Current Biology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217301999). The code here was used as part of the quality control pipeline in [Arcila et al. (2021) in *Systematic Biology*](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/70/6/1123/6204118).
